<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Do you feel like life are full of uncertainties? You never know what will go right or wrong. What if I am not sure how my life turns out? I am scared just like most of the college students that feel the weight of overwhelming pressure from the real world. I guess I’m one of them now. </p>
    
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Entering college is like having a trial into the real world. What I mean by real world is having a job. Working with other people, having different roles, and understanding that you must take one task seriously. As a computer science student, I think that we have many opportunities with this field. Having that said, pa’no kung hindi ko alam sa’n ako belong? Having this pressure kung ano nga ba dapat ang marating ko. It kept on bugging me dahil 2nd Year na ng college at isa pa sa mga dahilan ay hindi ko pa master ang field ko. But one thing’s for sure, i have to finish college. That’s the one thing that I can promise not just to myself, but also to my parents. As I realize these things, I have to set-up a plan para ‘di ma-stuck sa ganitong sitwasyon. Algorithm ika nga sa computer world. I know it makes no sense being not sure career ahead of you but it doesn’t mean you don’t have a future or dream at all. You are you and don't let anyone dictate what your future should be.</p>
     
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">We have our own paces and paths, but I hope we don't pressure ourselves too much. Take one step at a time and focus on the present. I know that we will be successful with our own careers that we will enjoy as well. I am not just talking to the readers but this is a kind reminder also to you, myself. </p>
