<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sa panahon natin ngayon, marami na ang innovations and technologies that make our lives easier. There are tools that make things convenient just like AI na ginagamit natin for school, work, and other purposes. But, is it a bad thing or a good thing? tinuturuan ba tayo ng mga innovations na 'to maging tamad at umasa sa technology? With all these questions in our mind, we can say that it is a double-edged sword — wanna know why?.</p>
  
<p style="text-indent:50px"> Humans are naturally finding ways to survive, cope, and learn. We usually explore and try things out for us to learn and adapt. Kapag tayong mga tao ay nahihirapan, madalas ay humahanap tayo ng iba't ibang paraan para matugunan ito. It is a natural selection after all, survival of the fittest. Either we adapt to live or just live to die. Pero lahat nang 'to ay masasabi natin kung tayo ay kasalukuyang na sa lumang panahon. Walang mga teknolohiya para tulungan tayo. But now? I don't think so. Our technology revolves around us rather us revolving around it. During my first encounter sa AI, 'di ko talaga gusto 'to dahil hindi ko naman gawa 'yan. We used it sa research during high school at sobrang naiilang ako tuwing gagamit kami ng AI, I'm not really used to it eh. As time goes by, lumawak na ang  sakop ng AI. It can be used for anything like academics, photos, or even creating own ideas. As I get used to it, hindi ko akalain na ngayong college ay magagamit ko nang husto ito. When I entered college and there are times I don't understand things with our lesson, I often reasearch it. Especially sa mathemtics. This experience with AI showed me that I can literally do anything with it. But, are we still human if we depend everything with AI? Literally, yes we are still human. I am a human. Just like what I said, AI is a double-edged sword because good and bad exists. It really depends on the person using it. Katulad ko na 2nd Year College Student, malaking tulong ang AI for reviewing and asking help for my different tasks. But I don't abuse AI, I still do tasks na kaya ko nang ako lang. Especially sa mga art-related tasks na nawawala ang meaning with AI. That's where I draw the line. Doing your own task means that you put blood, sweat, and tears to it. Lahat ng effort, pagod, idea, at creativity ay nanggaling sayo. It takes a lot of time for you to create an original work and that makes you human.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 50px"> But with all of these downsides, we can't deny na malaking tulong talaga ang AI sa panahon natin ngayon. As what I said, it can literally do anything and there's nothing to be afraid of with that. AI cannot harm us, other humans can. We shouldn't be afraid with technology because it is a progress to our world. Innovations were being made most of the time for our benefit and we should not stop that. We should still be afraid of our own kind, humans. Humans are the one controlling the technology and I think that we are also the one accountable if AI will be used for bad things. We should be the one aware of the good and bad because we have our own conscience. AI doesn't have that. Our emotion, logic, and together with conscience is what makes us human. I, myself, cannot stop AI  because whether I use it or not it will still continue from evolving.</p>
