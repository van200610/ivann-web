<p style="text-indent: 50px;"> You know what's  harder than academics? Having no time for yourself. Yes, you read it right. Sometimes we should make ourselves free from worry about our schoolworks, it's just very overwhelming. I, myself, tend to make myself relaxed by the end of the week. How? By playing volleyball.</p>
    
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Volleyball wasn't my first sport. It wasn't an option to be my hobby at all. It started when we had a sportsfest way back Grade 11, yes only 3 years ago. Basketball talaga from the start ang sport ko, I started noong ako ay 3 years old pa lamang. I don't know what went wrong pero hindi ko na naramdaman ang spark ng basketball pagtagal. That's when my heart skips a beat when I felt the enjoyment noong sportsfest sa volleyball. To put the cherry on top, nag-champion kami. From that moment, tuloy-tuloy na ang aking pagkahook sa volleyball. Having plays every Saturday or Sunday just to ease everything. It made me not only physically fit, but also mentally. It became my stress reliever up until now. When I entered college, it was my dream to be a part of varsity ng isang university. But I guess it wasn't my time noong pumasok ako ng UE. I seeked improvements and help from other players na mas marunong sa akin. It didn't just became a hobby, it's my passion. I always wait for the week to end just to play volleyball. Kahit gaano kabigat ang college at idagdag mo pa ang ibang personal problems, it became bearable dahil sa paglalaro ng volleyball. As what the title says, I'm spiking all the stress out. It's for my own sanity.</p>
     
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">What I'm saying is, dapat lahat tayo atleast once a week ay may ginagawa na makakatanggal ng pagod at stress. Hindi kinakailangan na sport, just something that can make us happy and relaxed. Ika nga, work-life balance. Hindi kinakailangan na puro school, trabaho, o stress. Kailangan din natin ng makakapagpasaya sa'tin. As we try to make things through sa buong linggo, we deserve some reward that can make us fulfilled.</p>
